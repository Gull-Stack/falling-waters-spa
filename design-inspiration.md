## Hero Section
- Full-screen video backgrounds (muted, looping)
- Minimal text overlay — 1 headline + 1 CTA
- "Book Now" button above the fold
- Soft color overlays on video (30-40% opacity)
- Tagline focuses on transformation, not services

## Navigation
- Sticky header with transparent → solid on scroll
- "Reserve" or "Book" always visible in nav
- Gift card link in main nav (not buried)
- Location finder for multi-location spas

## Color Psychology
- **Primary:** Soft neutrals — cream, taupe, sage green, soft blue
- **Accent:** Warm gold or rose gold for luxury feel
- **Avoid:** Harsh whites, bright saturated colors
- **Text:** Dark charcoal (#1a1a1a) on light backgrounds
- **Background:** Off-white (#faf8f5) or light cream

## Typography
- **Headlines:** Elegant serif (Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond)
- **Body:** Clean sans-serif (Inter, Avenir, Lato)
- **Line height:** Generous (1.6-1.8 for readability)
- **Quote blocks:** Large, elegant, with testimonials
- **Size:** Body 16-18px minimum

## Content Structure

### Services Organization
Organize by BENEFIT, not treatment type:
- "Rest" / "Awaken" / "Heal" (Burke Williams approach)
- "Restore" / "Recharge" / "Renew" (Exhale approach)
- Makes emotional connection vs clinical listing

### Key Pages
- **First-time visitor guide** — reduces booking anxiety
- **Spa etiquette/policies** — sets expectations
- **Team member bios** — builds trust
- **Virtual tour** — luxury differentiator

### What's Included Section
Use icons + short descriptions:
- ✓ Robes & slippers
- ✓ Relaxation lounge access
- ✓ Refreshments
- ✓ Amenities (sauna, steam, etc.)

## Trust Signals
- Real Google reviews with star ratings
- Years in business badge ("Since 2008")
- "Book with confidence" messaging
- Team member photos with credentials
- Awards and certifications

## Conversion Elements
- **Sticky booking bar** (especially mobile)
- **Gift card CTAs** on every page
- **Membership benefits** prominently featured
- **Package deals** highlighted
- **"Book Now" buttons** — multiple per page

## Luxury Design Touches
- Generous white space (don't crowd content)
- Slow, elegant animations (fade-in, parallax)
- High-quality photography (NEVER stock photos)
- Ken Burns effect on hero images
- Subtle hover states

## Mobile Experience
- Tap-to-call phone number
- Simplified hamburger menu
- Booking CTA fixed at bottom of screen
- Swipeable service cards
- Touch-friendly buttons (44px+ tap targets)

## Key Messaging Patterns

### Headlines That Work
